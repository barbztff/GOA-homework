<h1>let's get to know the programming languages.</h1>

<p>The first programming language was developed in 1883 when Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage worked together on the Analytical Engine, which was a primitive mechanical computer.</p>
<p>in the 1950s. The first programming language that was successfully used was Assembly language, which was used for directly controlling computer systems.</p>
<p>now,we work with many kinds of programming languanges. most common ones are  python; java; javascript; C; kotlin and so on. </p> 
<h1>what are these used for?</h1>
<h4>HTML/CSS are NOT considered to be programming languages</h4>
<p>why? because they lack the ability to manipulate data and logic.</p>
<p>1. HTML(HyperText Markup Language) is the standart, used to create and structure content on the web. It provides the basic structure of web pages by defining the content, elements, and how they should be displayed by the web browser. HTML is extremely common and essential in the world of web development. In fact, it is the core building block for creating websites and web applications. </p>
<p>2. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a styling, used to control the presentation, layout, and visual appearance of a web page written in HTML. While HTML provides the structure and content of a webpage, CSS defines how that content should look—such as colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning.</p>
<p>HTML defines the structure of the page (like headings, paragraphs, links, etc.), while CSS defines the style (colors, fonts, margins, etc.).</p>
<p>just like HTML,CSS is also very common.</p>
<h3>directly the languages.</h3> 
<h5>let's start off with PYTHON</h5>
<p>Python is one of the most popular and versatile programming languages in the world. Known for its simplicity, readability, and broad range of applications, Python is widely used by both beginners and experienced developers. Python’s simplicity, versatility, and massive ecosystem make it one of the most popular and widely-used programming languages in the world. From web development to data science to automation, Python’s applications are vast and growing. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced programmer, learning Python is an excellent choice.</p>
<h5>JAVA</h5>
<p>Java is one of the most widely used and enduring programming languages in the world, known for its platform independence, robustness, and scalability. Java is a general-purpose, object-oriented language designed to be portable, secure, and efficient. It’s been around for more than 25 years and continues to be a cornerstone in the development of large-scale applications, mobile apps, enterprise systems, and much more.</p>
